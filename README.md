# cluster-counting
The notebook for counting the number of  C2H2 domain clusters of different size in C2H2 proteins. It also counts total number of clusters in proteome, median number of C2H2 domains per protein and median cluster size.
It is written to take as inputs iTOL-formatted .txt files from SMART database (http://smart.embl.de/smart/complete_tree.cgi?ID=ZnF_C2H2) and tsv-formatted files from InterPro/Uniprot database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR013087/taxonomy/uniprot/#table).
Can be adapted to count any other clusters of protein domains
